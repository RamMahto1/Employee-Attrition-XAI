## End to End Employee-Attrition-XAI

# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company or stay, based on different factors like age, job role, salary, and work-life balance.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project
The main goal is to help companies understand what causes employees to leave and take action early to reduce attrition.  
I used machine learning to find patterns and predict attrition.

## ðŸ§  Steps I Followed
1. Data Loading â€“ Loaded the HR dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)â€“ Checked missing values, data types, and visualized key trends.
3. Feature Engineering â€“ Converted categorical values to numeric and handled imbalance.
4. Model Building â€“ Trained different models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
5. Model Evaluation â€“ Checked accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
6. Final Model â€“ Selected the best model based on overall performance.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
The final model predicts employee attrition with high accuracy.  
It can help HR departments identify at-risk employees and take preventive steps.

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.  
- Connect with a live HR dashboard for real-time predictions.
